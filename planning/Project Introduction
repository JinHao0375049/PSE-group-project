Project Introduction - Guided Learning Roadmap Platform

A lot of students tend to struggle with learning, but because they lack guidance and a structured learning procedure. This project plans to prototype a Guided Learning Roadmap Platform, this aligns with SDG 4- Quality Education, it's designed to help students achieve their learning goals one step at a time.

Students begin by choosing a subject or a topic of their interest, focusing and defining on what they want to achieve and it identifies what they need to learn first. The platform then generates a structured roadmap with milestones that the student can follow and track progress as they go along. The platform also provides recommended resources to guide the students. If the students encounters any difficulty, a peer to peer support feature can be allocated to them to seek help and be supported by peers that are experts in that topic.

Through combining goal setting and guided progression, recommended resources and peer to peer support, the platform will be able to support students by having them learn in a more organized, accessible and friendly matter. This proves that software and technology is able to improve educational outcomes through structure and accessibility
